  # You are given a user's prompt.
  # To answer the user's prompt, you need to think step by step to arrive at a final answer.
  #
  # ----- START OF USER'S PROMPT -----
  # What is 5 + 5?
  #
  # You must answer with only an integer (use no other characters).
  # ----- END OF USER'S PROMPT -----
  #
  # What are the steps you would take to answer the user's prompt?
  # Describe your thought process in the following format:
  #   >> step 1: <step 1 description>
  #   >> step 2: <step 2 description>
  #   (etc.)
  #
  # When you are done, you must type:
  #   FINISH[<put here your final answer to the user's prompt>]
  #
  # Make sure your final answer follows the logical conclusion of your thought process.
  # --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
  # >> step 1: Recognize that the user's prompt is a simple arithmetic question asking for
  # the sum of two numbers.
  #
  # >> step 2: Identify the specific numbers mentioned in the prompt, which are 5 and 5.
  #
  # >> step 3: Recall basic addition facts from memory or knowledge.
  # In this case, knowing that 5 + 0 = 5, 5 + 1 = 6, 5 + 2 = 7, and so on up to 5 + 4 = 9,
  # it is clear that the next step in adding 5 to itself would be to keep the same sum.
  #
  # >> step 4: Apply the addition principle by considering the original number (5) as being
  # added to itself once more. Since 5 + 1 = 6 and the process of adding 1 increases the total
  # sum, then 5 + 2 must equal 7, thus indicating a direct progression in the sum as the additive
  # amount increases.
  #
  # >> step 5: From steps 3 and 4, conclude that since 5 added to itself (once) would be 10,
  # then when it is added again (to itself), it would continue from the last result which was
  # achieved by adding one more than the original number. Therefore, it must follow the pattern
  # established in step 3 where each additional amount increases the total sum.
  #
  # >> step 6: Now knowing that the operation of adding a second 5 to the first one results in
  # increasing the sum to the next integer after 10 (based on steps 3 and 4), determine what the
  # next integer is after 10. Knowing that integers are whole numbers without fractions, it's
  # clear that if you add another unit to 10, it becomes 11.
  #
  # FINISH[10]
  # [1] 10
