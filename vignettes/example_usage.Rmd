### Setup an LLM provider

`tidyprompt` can be used with any LLM provider capable of completing a chat.

At the moment, `tidyprompt` includes pre-built functions to connect with various
LLM providers, such as Ollama, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Mistral, Groq, XAI (Grok), and Google Gemini.

With the `llm_provider` function, you can easily write a hook for any other LLM provider.
You could make API calls using the `httr` package or use another R package that already has
a hook for the LLM provider you want to use. If your API of choice follows the structure
of the OpenAI API, you can very easily call the `llm_provider_openai` function and change
the relevant parameters (like the url and the API key).


```r
# Ollama running on local PC
ollama <- llm_provider_ollama(
  parameters = list(model = "llama3.1:8b"),
)

# OpenAI API
openai <- llm_provider_openai(
  parameters = list(model = "gpt-4o-mini")
)

# Various providers via OpenRouter (e.g., Anthropic)
openrouter <- llm_provider_openrouter(
  parameters = list(model = "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet")
)

# ... functions also included for Mistral, Groq, XAI (Grok), and Google Gemini

# ... or easily create your own hook for any other LLM provider;
#   see ?llm_provider for more information; also take a look at the source code of
#   llm_provider_ollama() and llm_provider_openai(). For APIs that follow the structure
#   of the OpenAI API for chat completion, you can use llm_provider_openai() and change
#   the relevant parameters (like the url and the API key).
```

### Basic prompting

A simple string serves as the base for a prompt.

By adding prompt wraps, you can influence various aspects of how the LLM handles the prompt,
while verifying that the output is structured and valid (including retries with feedback to the LLM if it is not).


```r
  "Hi there!" |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> Hi there!
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with, or would you like to chat?
#> [1] "It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with, or would you like to chat?"
```
`add_text` is a simple example of a prompt wrap. It simply adds some text at the end of the base prompt.


```r
  "Hi there!" |>
    add_text("What is a large language model? Explain in 10 words.") |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> Hi there!
#> 
#> What is a large language model? Explain in 10 words.
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> Complex software program that generates human-like text through machine learning algorithms.
#> [1] "Complex software program that generates human-like text through machine learning algorithms."
```
You can also construct the final prompt text, without sending it to an LLM provider.


```r
  "Hi there!" |>
    add_text("What is a large language model? Explain in 10 words.")
#> <tidyprompt>
#> The base prompt is modified by a wrapper function, resulting in:
#> > Hi there!
#> > 
#> > What is a large language model? Explain in 10 words. 
#> Use '<tidyprompt>$prompt_wraps' to show the wrapper functions.
#> Use '<tidyprompt>$base_prompt' to show the base prompt text.
#> Use '<tidyprompt> |> construct_prompt_text()' to show the full prompt text.
```

### Retrieving output in a specific format

Using prompt wraps, you can force the LLM to return the output in a specific format.
You can also extract the output to turn it from a character into another data type.

For instance, the `answer_as_integer` prompt wrap will force the LLM to return an integer.

To achieve this, the prompt wrap will add some text to the base prompt, asking
the LLM to reply with an integer. However, the prompt wrap does more: it also
will attempt to extract and validate the integer from the LLM's response. If
extraction or validation fails, feedback is sent back to the LLM, after which
the LLM can retry answering the prompt.


```r
  "What is 2 + 2?" |>
    answer_as_integer() |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> What is 2 + 2?
#> 
#> You must answer with only an integer (use no other characters).
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> 4
#> [1] 4
```
Below is an example of a prompt which will initially fail, but will succeed after a retry.


```r
  "What is 2 + 2?" |>
    add_text("Please write out your reply in words, use no numbers.") |>
    answer_as_integer(add_instruction_to_prompt = FALSE) |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> What is 2 + 2?
#> 
#> Please write out your reply in words, use no numbers.
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> Four.
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> You must answer with only an integer (use no other characters).
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> 4
#> [1] 4
```
### Adding a reasoning mode to the LLM

Prompt wraps may also be used to add a reasoning mode to the LLM. It is hypothesized that this could
improve the LLM's performance on more complex tasks.

For instance, function `answer_by_chain_of_thought` will add chain of thought reasoning mode to the LLM.
This wraps the base prompt within a request for the LLM to reason step by step, asking
it to provide the final answer within 'FINISH[<final answer here>]'. An extraction
function then ensures only the final answer is returned.


```r
  "What is 2 + 2?" |>
    answer_by_chain_of_thought() |>
    answer_as_integer() |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> You are given a user's prompt.
#> To answer the user's prompt, you need to think step by step to arrive at a final answer.
#> 
#> ----- START OF USER'S PROMPT -----
#> What is 2 + 2?
#> 
#> You must answer with only an integer (use no other characters).
#> ----- END OF USER'S PROMPT -----
#> 
#> What are the steps you would take to answer the user's prompt?
#> Describe your thought process in the following format:
#>   >> step 1: <step 1 description>
#>   >> step 2: <step 2 description>
#>   (etc.)
#> 
#> When you are done, you must type:
#> FINISH[<put here your final answer to the user's prompt>]
#> 
#> Make sure your final answer follows the logical conclusion of your thought process.
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> Here are the steps I would take:
#> 
#> >> step 1: Identify that the problem is a basic arithmetic question involving addition.
#> The problem statement "What is 2 + 2?" indicates that I need to add two numbers together.
#> 
#> >> step 2: Recall the concept of basic addition facts from memory or prior knowledge.
#> I know that adding two identical numbers (in this case, 2) together should result in a specific answer that I can recall.
#> 
#> >> step 3: Apply the addition fact to arrive at the solution.
#> I remember that the sum of 1+1 is 2, and since we're doubling one of the numbers from that equation, the answer will also double. Therefore, 2 + 2 should equal 4.
#> 
#> FINISH4
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> Error, could not parse your final answer.
#> Please type: 'FINISH[<put here your final answer to the original prompt>]'
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> Here is the corrected response:
#> 
#> >> step 1: Identify that the problem is a basic arithmetic question involving addition.
#> The problem statement "What is 2 + 2?" indicates that I need to add two numbers together.
#> 
#> >> step 2: Recall the concept of basic addition facts from memory or prior knowledge.
#> I know that adding two identical numbers (in this case, 2) together should result in a specific answer that I can recall.
#>

#> 
#> FINISH[4]
#> [1] 4
```

### Giving tools to the LLM (autonomous function-calling)

With `tidyprompt` and the `add_tools` prompt wrap, you can define your own
R functions and give the LLM the ability to call them.
This enables the LLM to retrieve additional information or take other actions.


```r
  # Define a function that returns fake data about the temperature in a location
  temperature_in_location <- function(
    location = c("Amsterdam", "Utrecht", "Enschede"),
    unit = c("Celcius", "Fahrenheit")
  ) {
    #' llm_tool::name temperature_in_location
    #'
    #' llm_tool::description Get the temperature in a location
    #'
    #' llm_tool::param location Location, must be one of: "Amsterdam", "Utrecht", "Enschede"
    #' llm_tool::param unit Unit, must be one of: "Celcius", "Fahrenheit"
    #'
    #' llm_tool::return The temperature in the specified location and unit
    #'
    #' llm_tool::example
    #' temperature_in_location("Amsterdam", "Fahrenheit")

    # As shown above, one can use docstring-like text to document the function.
    #   This will provide the LLM information on what the function does,
    #   and how it should be used.

    location <- match.arg(location)
    unit <- match.arg(unit)

    temperature_celcius <- switch(
      location,
      "Amsterdam" = 32.5,
      "Utrecht" = 19.8,
      "Enschede" = 22.7
    )

    if (unit == "Celcius") {
      return(temperature_celcius)
    } else {
      return(temperature_celcius * 9/5 + 32)
    }
  }

  # Ask the LLM a question which can be answered with the function
  "Hi, what is the weather temperature in Enschede?" |>
    add_text("I want to know the Celcius degrees.") |>
    answer_as_integer() |>
    add_tools(temperature_in_location) |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> Hi, what is the weather temperature in Enschede?
#> 
#> I want to know the Celcius degrees.
#> 
#> You must answer with only an integer (use no other characters).
#> 
#> If you need more information, you can call functions to help you.
#> To call a function, type:
#>   FUNCTION[<function name here>](<argument 1>, <argument 2>, etc...)
#> 
#> The following functions are available:
#> 
#> function name: temperature_in_location
#> description: Get the temperature in a location
#> arguments:
#>     - location: Location, must be one of: "Amsterdam", "Utrecht", "Enschede"
#>     - unit: Unit, must be one of: "Celcius", "Fahrenheit"
#> return value: The temperature in the specified location and unit
#> example usage: FUNCTION[temperature_in_location]("Amsterdam", "Fahrenheit")
#> 
#> After you call a function, wait until you receive more information.
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> To get the current temperature in Enschede in Celsius degrees, I will call the `temperature_in_location` function.
#> 
#> FUNCTION[temperature_in_location]("Enschede", "Celcius")
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> function called: temperature_in_location
#> arguments used: location = Enschede, unit = Celcius
#> result: 22.7
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> The current temperature in Enschede is 22.7 degrees Celsius.
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (llama3.1:8b): ---
#> You must answer with only an integer (use no other characters).
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
#> 22
#> [1] 22
```

### Code generation and evaluation

`answer_as_code` is a more advanced prompt wrap, which has various options
to enable LLM code generation. R code can be extracted, parsed
for validity, and optionally be evaluated in a dedicated R session (using the
`callr` package). The prompt wrap can also be set to 'tool mode' (with `output_as_tool = TRUE`),
where the output of R code is returned to the LLM, so that it can be used to formulate
a final answer.


```r
# From prompt to ggplot
paste0(
  "Create a scatter plot of miles per gallon (mpg) versus",
  " horsepower (hp) for the cars in the mtcars dataset.",
  " Use different colors to represent the number of cylinders (cyl).",
  " Make the plot nice and readable,",
  " but also be creative, a little crazy, and have humour!"
) |>
  answer_as_code(
    pkgs_to_use = c("ggplot2"),
    evaluate_code = TRUE,
    return_mode = "object"
  ) |>
  send_prompt(openai)
#> --- Sending request to LLM provider (gpt-4o-mini): ---
#> Create a scatter plot of miles per gallon (mpg) versus horsepower (hp) for the cars in the mtcars dataset. Use different colors to represent the number of cylinders (cyl). Make the plot nice and readable, but also be creative, a little crazy, and have humour!
#> 
#> You must code in the programming language 'R' to answer this prompt.
#> You can use functions from these packages: ggplot2.
#> You may not install or load any additional packages.
#> The R code should produce an object that answers the prompt.
#> --- Receiving response from LLM provider: ---
```

````
#> Certainly! Below is an R code snippet that creates a scatter plot of miles per gallon (mpg) versus horsepower (hp) for the `mtcars` dataset, using different colors to represent the number of cylinders (cyl). The plot is designed to be both readable and a bit playful.
#> 
#> ```r
#> # Load necessary library
#> library(ggplot2)
#> 
#> # Create a scatter plot of mpg vs hp with color by number of cylinders
#> plot_mpg_hp <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) + 
#>   geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.7) + 
#>   labs(title = "MPG vs Horsepower: The Cylinder Chronicles!",
#>        x = "Horsepower (hp) 🚗💨",
#>        y = "Miles Per Gallon (mpg) ⛽️",
#>        color = "Number of Cylinders (Cyl) 🥁") +
#>   theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
#>   theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5, color = "darkblue", size = 18),
#>         legend.position = "top",
#>         panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "lightgrey", size = 0.5),
#>         panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
#>         axis.title = element_text(face = "italic", color = "darkred")) +
#>   scale_color_manual(values = c("4" = "green", "6" = "orange", "8" = "red")) +
#>   geom_text(aes(label = rownames(mtcars)), vjust = -1, hjust = 0.5, color = "black", size = 3.5, check_overlap = TRUE) +
#>   annotate("text", x = max(mtcars$hp) - 10, y = max(mtcars$mpg) - 2, label = "Fuel efficiency\nis a serious business!\nCylinders just like\nparty hats 🎉", 
#>            color = "purple", size = 5, fontface = "italic", hjust = 1)
#> 
#> # Display the plot
#> print(plot_mpg_hp)
#> ```
#> 
#> ### Code Explanation:
#> - We start by loading the `ggplot2` library.
#> - We map `hp` (horsepower) to the x-axis and `mpg` (miles per gallon) to the y-axis, while coloring points based on the number of `cyl` (cylinders).
#> - We add a playful title and customize axis labels with emojis for a humorous touch.
#> - The `theme_minimal()` function is used for a clean look, combined with custom styling for titles and grid lines.
#> - `scale_color_manual()` specifies different colors for points representing different numbers of cylinders.
#> - We utilize `geom_text()` to label points with the car names, and we also use `annotate()` to add a humorous message to the plot.
#> - Finally, we print the plot. 
#> 
#> This will create a vibrant, humorous, and informative scatter plot!
````

### Creating your own prompt wraps

Under the hood, prompts are just lists of a base prompt (a string) and a series of prompt wraps.

You can thus create a function which takes a prompt and appends a new prompt wrap to it.

Take a look at the source code for function `add_text`:


```r
add_text <- function(
    prompt,
    text, position = c("after", "before"), sep = "\n\n"
) {
  position <- match.arg(position)

  modify_fn <- function(original_prompt_text) {
    if (position == "after") {
      paste(original_prompt_text, text, sep = sep)
    } else {
      paste(text, original_prompt_text, sep = sep)
    }
  }

  prompt_wrap(prompt, modify_fn)
}
```

More complex prompt wraps may also add extraction and validation functions. Take a look
at the source code for function `answer_as_integer`:


```r
answer_as_integer <- function(
    prompt,
    min = NULL,
    max = NULL,
    add_instruction_to_prompt = TRUE
) {
  instruction <- "You must answer with only an integer (use no other characters)."

  if (!is.null(min) && !is.null(max)) {
    instruction <- paste(instruction, glue::glue("Enter an integer between {min} and {max}."))
  } else if (!is.null(min)) {
    instruction <- paste(instruction, glue::glue("Enter an integer greater than or equal to {min}."))
  } else if (!is.null(max)) {
    instruction <- paste(instruction, glue::glue("Enter an integer less than or equal to {max}."))
  }


  # Define modification/extraction/validation functions:
  modify_fn <- function(original_prompt_text) {
    if (!add_instruction_to_prompt) {
      return(original_prompt_text)
    }

    glue::glue("{original_prompt_text}\n\n{instruction}")
  }

  extraction_fn <- function(x) {
    extracted <- suppressWarnings(as.integer(x))
    if (is.na(extracted)) {
      return(create_llm_feedback(instruction))
    }
    return(extracted)
  }

  validation_fn <- function(x) {
    if (!is.null(min) && x < min) {
      return(create_llm_feedback(glue::glue(
        "The number should be greater than or equal to {min}."
      )))
    }
    if (!is.null(max) && x > max) {
      return(create_llm_feedback(glue::glue(
        "The number should be less than or equal to {max}."
      )))
    }
    return(TRUE)
  }

  prompt_wrap(prompt, modify_fn, extraction_fn, validation_fn)
}
```

They key difference between an extraction and validation function is that an
extraction function alters the LLM's response and passes on the altered response
to next extraction and/or validation functions, and eventually to the
return statement of send_prompt (if extractions and validations are succesful).
A validation function, on the other hand, only checks if the LLM's response passes a logical test. Both
extraction and validation functions can return feedback to the LLM.

For more information, on what you can do with prompt wraps, see the documentation
of the `prompt_wrap` class creator function: `create_prompt_wrap`. For examples of prompt wrap functions,
see, for instance the documentation and source code of `add_text`, `answer_as_integer`,
`answer_by_chain_of_thought`, and `add_tools`.
