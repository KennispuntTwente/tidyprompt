### Setup an LLM provider

'tidyprompt' can be used with any LLM provider capable of completing a chat.

At the moment, 'tidyprompt' includes pre-built functions to connect with various
LLM providers, such as Ollama, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Mistral, Groq, XAI (Grok), and Google Gemini.

With the `llm_provider-class`, you can easily write a hook for any other LLM provider.
You could make API calls using the 'httr2' package or use another R package that already has
a hook for the LLM provider you want to use. If your API of choice follows the structure
of the OpenAI API, you can call `llm_provider_openai()` and change
the relevant parameters (like the URL and the API key).

```{r llm_provider}
# Ollama running on local PC
ollama <- llm_provider_ollama(
  parameters = list(model = "llama3.1:8b"),
)

# OpenAI API
openai <- llm_provider_openai(
  parameters = list(model = "gpt-4o-mini")
)

# Various providers via OpenRouter (e.g., Anthropic)
openrouter <- llm_provider_openrouter(
  parameters = list(model = "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet")
)

# ... functions also included for Mistral, Groq, XAI (Grok), and Google Gemini

# ... or easily create your own hook for any other LLM provider;
#   see ?llm_provider-class for more information; also take a look at the source code of
#   llm_provider_ollama() and llm_provider_openai(). For APIs that follow the structure
#   of the OpenAI API for chat completion, you can use llm_provider_openai()
```

### Basic prompting

A simple string serves as the base for a prompt.

By adding prompt wraps, you can influence various aspects of how the LLM handles the prompt,
while verifying that the output is structured and valid (including retries with feedback to the LLM if it is not).

```{r prompt_example1, cache=FALSE}
  "Hi there!" |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
```
`add_text()` is a simple example of a prompt wrap. It simply adds some text at the end of the base prompt.

```{r prompt_example2, cache=FALSE}
  "Hi there!" |>
    add_text("What is a large language model? Explain in 10 words.") |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
```
You can also construct the final prompt text, without sending it to an LLM provider.

```{r prompt_example3, cache=FALSE}
  "Hi there!" |>
    add_text("What is a large language model? Explain in 10 words.")
```

### Retrieving output in a specific format

Using prompt wraps, you can force the LLM to return the output in a specific format.
You can also extract the output to turn it from a character into another data type.

For instance, `answer_as_integer()` adds a prompt wrap which forces the LLM
to reply with an integer.

To achieve this, the prompt wrap will add some text to the base prompt, asking
the LLM to reply with an integer. However, the prompt wrap does more: it also
will attempt to extract and validate the integer from the LLM's response. If
extraction or validation fails, feedback is sent back to the LLM, after which
the LLM can retry answering the prompt. Because the extraction function turns the
original character response into a numeric value, the final output from
`send_prompt()` will also be a numeric type.

```{r answer_as_integer1, cache=FALSE}
  "What is 2 + 2?" |>
    answer_as_integer() |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
```
Below is an example of a prompt which will initially fail, but will succeed after
`llm_feedback()` and a retry.

```{r answer_as_integer2, cache=FALSE}
  "What is 2 + 2?" |>
    add_text("Please write out your reply in words, use no numbers.") |>
    answer_as_integer(add_instruction_to_prompt = FALSE) |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
```

'tidyprompt' offers various other 'answer_as' functions, such as `answer_as_boolean()`, `answer_as_regex()`,
`answer_as_named_list()`, `answer_as_code()`, and `answer_as_json()`.

##### JSON output

`answer_as_json()` may be especially powerful when your LLM provider and model have native support for
returning JSON objects and adhering to JSON schemas (e.g., OpenAI, Ollama). Text-based handling is however always
possible, also for providers which do not natively support such functions. This means that
you can always switch between providers while ensuring the results will be in the correct format.

It should also be noted that native JSON enforcement may also restrict the model too much,
so it is always good to test and see what works best for your use case. In our experience,
text-based handling is often more flexible and robust, especially when combining
multiple prompt wraps. Note also that JSON schemas may not enforce all qualities
you are looking for in the output, so you may still need to add additional prompt wraps
to ensure the output is as desired.

### Adding a reasoning mode to the LLM

Prompt wraps may also be used to add a reasoning mode to the LLM. It is hypothesized that this could
improve the LLM's performance on more complex tasks.

For instance, `answer_by_chain_of_thought()` will add chain of thought reasoning mode to the
prompt evaluation by the LLM.
The function wraps the base prompt text within a request for the LLM to reason step by step, asking
it to provide the final answer within 'FINISH[<final answer here>]'. An extraction
function then ensures only the final answer is returned.

```{r mode_cot, cache=FALSE}
  "What is 2 + 2?" |>
    answer_by_chain_of_thought() |>
    answer_as_integer() |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
```

### Giving tools to the LLM (autonomous function-calling)

With `answer_using_tools()`, you can enable your LLM to call R functions.
This enables the LLM to autonomously retrieve additional information or take other actions.

`answer_using_tools()` automatically extracts documentation when it is available
for base R functions and functions from packages. Types are inferred from the
default arguments of the function. If you want to define a custom function and/or override the default documentation,
you can use `tools_add_docs()`. See example usage in the documentation
of `answer_using_tools()`.

`answer_using_tools()` supports both text-based function calling and native function calling (via API
parameters, currently implemented for OpenAI and Ollama API structures).

```{r tool_example2, cache=FALSE}
  "What are the files in my current directory?" |>
    answer_using_tools(list.files) |>
    send_prompt(ollama)
```

### Code generation and evaluation

`answer_as_code()` provides a more advanced prompt wrap, which has various options
to enable LLM code generation. R code can be extracted, parsed
for validity, and optionally be evaluated in a dedicated R session (using the
'callr' package). The prompt wrap can also be set to 'tool mode' (with `output_as_tool = TRUE`),
where the output of R code is returned to the LLM, so that it can be used to formulate
a final answer.

```{r include=FALSE}
openai$verbose <- FALSE; options(tidyprompt.verbose = FALSE)
```

```{r answer_as_code1, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# From prompt to ggplot
plot <- paste0(
  "Create a scatter plot of miles per gallon (mpg) versus",
  " horsepower (hp) for the cars in the mtcars dataset.",
  " Use different colors to represent the number of cylinders (cyl).",
  " Make the plot nice and readable,",
  " but also be creative, a little crazy, and have humour!"
) |>
  answer_as_code(
    pkgs_to_use = c("ggplot2"),
    evaluate_code = TRUE,
    return_mode = "object"
  ) |>
  send_prompt(openai)
plot
```
![plot](figure/answer_as_code1-1.png)

```{r include=FALSE}
openai$verbose <- TRUE; options(tidyprompt.verbose = TRUE)
```

### Creating your own prompt wraps

Using `prompt_wrap()`, you can create your own prompt wraps.
An input for `prompt_wrap()` wrap may be string or a tidyprompt object. If you
pass a string, it will be automatically turned into a tidyprompt object.

Under the hood, a tidyprompt object is just a list with a base prompt (a string) and a series of prompt
wraps. `prompt_wrap()` adds a new prompt wrap to the list of prompt wraps. Each prompt wrap is a list
with a modification function, an extraction function, and/or a validation function (at least
one of these functions must be present). The modification function alters the prompt text,
the extraction function applies a transformation to the LLM's response, and the validation function
checks if the (transformed) LLM's response is valid.

Both extraction and validation functions can return feedback to the LLM, using
`llm_feedback()`. When an extraction or validation function returns this, a
message is sent back to the LLM, and the LLM can retry answering the prompt according
to the feedback. Feedback messages may be a reiteration of instruction or a specific error
message which occured during extraction or validation. When all extractions and validations
have been applied without resulting in feedback, the LLM's response (after transformations
by the extraction functions) will be returned. (`send_prompt()` is responsible
for executing this process.)

Below is a simple example of a prompt wrap, which just adds some text to the base prompt:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
prompt <- "Hi there!" |>
  prompt_wrap(
    modify_fn = function(base_prompt) {
      paste(base_prompt, "How are you?", sep = "\n\n")
    }
  )
```

Shorter notation of the above would be:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
prompt <- "Hi there!" |>
  prompt_wrap(\(x) paste(x, "How are you?", sep = "\n\n"))
```

Often times, it may be preferred to make a function which takes a prompt and
returns a wrapped prompt:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_prompt_wrap <- function(prompt) {
  modify_fn <- function(base_prompt) {
    paste(base_prompt, "How are you?", sep = "\n\n")
  }

  prompt_wrap(prompt, modify_fn)
}
prompt <- "Hi there!" |>
  my_prompt_wrap()
```

Take look at the source code of `answer_as_boolean()`, which also uses extraction:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
answer_as_boolean <- function(
    prompt,
    true_definition = NULL,
    false_definition = NULL,
    add_instruction_to_prompt = TRUE
) {
  instruction <- "You must answer with only TRUE or FALSE (use no other characters)."
  if (!is.null(true_definition))
    instruction <- paste(instruction, glue::glue("TRUE means: {true_definition}."))
  if (!is.null(false_definition))
    instruction <- paste(instruction, glue::glue("FALSE means: {false_definition}."))

  modify_fn <- function(original_prompt_text) {
    if (!add_instruction_to_prompt) {
      return(original_prompt_text)
    }

    glue::glue("{original_prompt_text}\n\n{instruction}")
  }

  extraction_fn <- function(x) {
    normalized <- tolower(trimws(x))
    if (normalized %in% c("true", "false")) {
      return(as.logical(normalized))
    }
    return(llm_feedback(instruction))
  }

  prompt_wrap(prompt, modify_fn, extraction_fn)
}
```

Take a look at the source code of, for instance, `answer_as_integer()`, `answer_by_chain_of_thought()`,
and `answer_using_tools()` for more advanced examples of prompt wraps.

#### Breaking out of the evaluation loop

In some cases, you may want to exit the extraction or validation process early. For instance,
your LLM may indicate that it is unable to answer the prompt. In such cases, you can have your
extraction or validation function return `llm_break()`. This will cause the evaluation loop
to break, forwarding to the return statement of `send_prompt()`. See `quit_if()`
for an example of this.

#### Extraction versus validation functions

Both extraction and validation functions can return `llm_break()` or `llm_feedback()`.
The difference between extraction and validation functions is only that an extraction may
transform the LLM response and pass it on to the next extraction and/or validation functions,
while a validation function only checks if the LLM response passes a logical test (without
altering the response). Thus, if you wish, you can perform validations in an
extraction function.

#### Prompt wrap types and order of application

When constructing the prompt text and when evaluating a prompt, prompt wraps are applied
prompt wrap after prompt wrap (e.g., first the extraction and validation functions of
one wrap, then of the other).

The order in which prompt wraps are applied is important. Currently, four types of prompt wraps
are distinguished: 'unspecified', 'break', 'mode', and 'tool'.

When constructing the prompt text,
prompt wraps are applied in the order of these types. Prompt wraps will be automatically reordered if
necesarry (keeping intact the order of prompt wraps of the same type).

When evaluating the prompt,
prompt wraps are applied in the reverse order of types (i.e., first 'tool', then 'mode', then 'break',
and finally 'unspecified'). This is because 'tool' prompt wraps may return a value to be used in
the final answer, 'mode' prompt wraps alter how a LLM forms a final answer,
'break' prompt wraps quit evaluation early based on a specific final answer, and 'unspecified'
prompt wraps are the most general type of prompt wraps which force a final answer
to be in a specific format.

#### Configuring a LLM provider with a prompt wrap

Advanced prompt wraps may wish to configure certain settings of a LLM provider.
For instance, `answer_as_json()` configures certain parameters of the LLM provider,
based on which LLM provider is being used (Ollama and OpenAI have different API parameters
available for JSON output). This is done by defining a `parameter_fn` within the prompt wrap;
`parameter_fn` is a function which takes the LLM provider as input and returns a list of parameters,
which will be set as the parameters of the LLM provider before sending the prompt. See
`prompt_wrap()` documentation and `answer_as_json()` for an example.

#### Configuring a prompt wrap based on the LLM provider or HTTP responses

`modify_fn`, `extraction_fn`, and `validation_fn` may take the
LLM provider as the second argument and the `http_list` (a list of all
HTTP responses made during `send_prompt()`) as the third argument. This allows for
advanced configuration of the prompt and the extraction and validation logic
based on the LLM provider and any data available the HTTP responses.

#### Configuring a prompt wrap based on other prompt wraps

`modify_fn`, `extraction_fn`, and `validation_fn` all have access to the `self`
object, which represents the tidyprompt object that they are a part of. This
allows for advanced configuration of the prompt and the extraction and validation logic
based on other prompt wraps.

#### 'Handler functions'

Prompt wraps may also include 'handler functions'. These are functions which are called
upon every received chat completion. This allows for advanced
processing of the LLM's responses, such as logging, tracking tokens, or other
custom processing. See the `prompt_wrap()` documentation for more information;
see the source code of `answer_using_tools()` for an example of a handler function.
