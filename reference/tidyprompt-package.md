# tidyprompt: Prompt Large Language Models and Enhance Their Functionality

Easily construct prompts and associated logic for interacting with large
language models (LLMs). 'tidyprompt' introduces the concept of prompt
wraps, which are building blocks that you can use to quickly turn a
simple prompt into a complex one. Prompt wraps do not just modify the
prompt text, but also add extraction and validation functions that will
be applied to the response of the LLM. This ensures that the user gets
the desired output. 'tidyprompt' can add various features to prompts and
their evaluation by LLMs, such as structured output, automatic feedback,
retries, reasoning modes, autonomous R function calling, and R code
generation and evaluation. It is designed to be compatible with any LLM
provider that offers chat completion.
