* This is a resubmission of a new release; thanks to the CRAN reviewer for the feedback.

* I have removed the single quotes around "LLMs" in the DESCRIPTION file.

* I have added return value documentation to chat_history.character, chat_history.data.frame,
and chat_history.default.

* I have replaced the use of `installed.packages()` by `requireNamespace()` in the
code (see R/answer_using_r.R).

* There are no references which describe the methods in this package.
