‚ùØ checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... [13s] NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Luka Koning <l.koning@kennispunttwente.nl>'
  
  Days since last update: 4

* I did several updates for supporting new API versions and compatibility with 
  the 'ellmer' package in the last days; see NEWS.md. Thus, despite being
  close to the last submission, this release does contain various important
  changes to the package (including also bug fixes and improved documentation).
  A new submission won't be made for at least 1-2 months from now; I, the
  maintainer, wanted to finish this release before my leave.
  Thank you for handling this submission.
