Description: 
  ‘tidyprompt’ is an R package to easily prompt large language models ('LLMs') and 
  enhance their functionality. A framework is provided which
  allows users to construct LLM prompts using 'tidyverse'-inspired piping syntax.
  'Prompt wraps' influence how a LLM handles the base prompt, through modifying
  the original text and applying extraction and validation functions to the LLM
  response. Users can choose from a library of pre-built prompt wraps or write
  their own. This allows for obtaining structured LLM output, with automatic feedback
  and retries if necessary. Additionally, the package supports LLM reasoning modes
  (e.g., chain of thought), autonomous R function calling, and R code generation and
  evaluation. 'tidyprompt' is compatible with any LLM provider that offers chat
  completions.
