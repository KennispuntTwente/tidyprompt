Description: 
  Easily construct prompts and associated logic for interacting with 
  large language models (LLMs). 
  'tidyprompt' introduces the concept of prompt wraps, which are building
  blocks that you can use to quickly turn a simple prompt into a complex
  one. Prompt wraps do not just modify the prompt text, but also add
  extraction and validation functions that will be applied to the response
  of the LLM. This ensures that the user gets the desired output.
  'tidyprompt' can add various features to prompts and their evaluation
  by LLMs, such as structured output, automatic feedback, retries, reasoning
  modes, autonomous R function calling, and R code generation and evaluation.
  It is designed to be compatible with any LLM provider that offers
  chat completion.
