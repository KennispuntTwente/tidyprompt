\title{Instruct LLM to answer a prompt with R code}
\usage{
answer_as_code(
  prompt,
  add_text = "You must code in the programming language 'R' to answer this prompt.",
  pkgs_to_use = c(),
  evaluate_code = TRUE,
  evaluation_session = NULL,
  list_packages = TRUE,
  list_objects = TRUE,
  send_back_output = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prompt}{A character string or a tidyprompt object}

\item{add_text}{Character string which will be added to the prompt text,
informing the LLM that they must code in R to answer the prompt.}

\item{pkgs_to_use}{A character vector of package names that may be used
in the R code that the LLM will generate}

\item{evaluate_code}{Logical indicating whether the R code should be
evaluated. If TRUE, the R code will be evaluated in an R session.}

\item{evaluation_session}{An r_session object (from the callr package) to
evaluate the R code. If NULL, a new r_session object will be created.}

\item{list_packages}{Logical indicating whether the LLM should be informed
about the packages that may be used in the R code}

\item{list_objects}{Logical indicating whether the LLM should be informed
about the objects that already exist in the R session, including their types}

\item{send_back_output}{Logical indicating whether the console output of the
evaluated R code should be sent back to the LLM. If so, the LLM can decide
if they can answer the prompt or if they need to modify their R code. Once
the LLM does not provide new R code (i.e., the prompt is being answered)
the extraction of this prompt wrap will end}
}
\value{
A tidyprompt object with the new prompt wrap added to it
}
\description{
This function adds a prompt wrap to a tidyprompt object that instructs the
LLM to answer the prompt with R code. There are various options to customize
the behavior of this prompt wrap, concerning the evaluation of the R code,
the packages that may be used, the objects that already exist in the R
session, and if the console output that should be sent back to the LLM. For
the evaluation of the R code, the 'callr' package is required. Please note:
automatic evaluation of generated R code may be dangerous to your system;
use this function with caution.
